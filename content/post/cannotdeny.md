<pre>
Oh baby, you know what’s gonna happen now
Just a good blues, bottle of nice wine
Please, don’t talk too much… toooo… tonight
Just listen, enjoy, drink and dream about… about love

You know, I saw you last time dancing alone
Your smile was so sweet
Oh baby, you know I got it wrong but I, but I, but I
I couldn’t say No
No I, I couldn’t say No, no, no, no, no, no, no, noooooo...  no 

...

(And then, you know… what needs to … happen now…	
You on your own thinking about the dance, that’s gone  		
Please, don’t think to… to call me back toooo… tonight				
Just see, imagine, drink and dream about another one  		

You know, I saw you once dancing alone
Your smile was not wrong
No, baby, no, you got it right but I, but I, but I
I then had to say No
Yes I… I had to say No, no, no, no, no, no, no, noooooo... no)
