<pre>
No risk, no fun, no fun in the long run
No family, all gone, nothing is really done
Day in, day out, TV on, TV off
Cooking, cleaning, just being, in fever on my own 

Hello friends, where have you been?
Me, I‘ve been fighting on this battlefield
Hello friends, where have you been?
I had to stand alone on my battlefield

Job center invites, job market in disguise
Forget your past, the future is still bright
I need to check it out, one follows me despite 
What remains is cholera, playing a painful bolero 

Hello friends, where have you been?			         
Me, I‘ve been fighting, on this battlefield
Hello my friends, where have you been?
I had to stand alone, on my battlefield

Hello friends, where have you been?			         
Me, I‘ve been fighting, on this battlefield
Hello my friends, where have you been?
I had to stand alone, on my battlefield

Hello friends, where have you been?			         
Me, I‘ve been fighting, on this battlefield
Hello my friends, where have you been?
I had to stand alone, so I let you be gone….
