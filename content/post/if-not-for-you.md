I don’t wanna gooooooo… this road
I don’t wanna take this turn in life without you

Early in life, you found me and hit me hard
Just few dates and quickly love was born and done
Then I made my odyssey, though you followed me all the way
Don’t be angry, please, I’m glad for what you did

&#09;I don’t wanna goooooooo this road
&#09;I don’t wanna take this turn in life without you
&#09;I don’t wanna siiiiiiiiiiing this song
&#09;I don’t wanna sing it, if this is not for you

I know, I know, I know, I should have done it all before
I hope, you are gonna forgive all those years that are gone
I wish, it’s not too late, not too late for us both
To stand side by side until our last days

&#09;I don’t wanna goooooooo this road
&#09;I don’t wanna take this turn in life without you
&#09;I don’t wanna siiiiiiiiiiing this song
&#09;I don’t wanna sing it, if this is not for you
&#09;I don’t wanna goooooooo this road
&#09;I don’t wanna take this turn in life without you
&#09;I don’t wanna siiiiiiiiiiing this song
&#09;I don’t wanna sing it, if this is not for you
